# Natural Gas Price Analysis With ARIMA

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price data to model and predict future gas prices. The dataset used spans several years and has been sourced from a public resource provided by Thomson Reuters, accessible at the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA): [Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdM.htm).

The objective of the project is to:

- Analyze historical trends in natural gas prices.
- Build a predictive model to forecast future prices.
- Provide insights into price fluctuations.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key trends and patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing time series models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA) to forecast future prices.
- **Extrapolation**: Estimating prices beyond the available data up to one year into the future.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and plots showcasing the predictions and model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from the EIA's historical Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices. Data can be accessed and downloaded from the following link:
- **[Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdM.htm)**

## Running the Code

To make it easier for you to run the project without needing to set up a local environment, you can run the notebook on **Google Colab**. Follow these steps:

1. Open Google Colab: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the Jupyter notebook (`Ver03_Task01_Natural_Gas_Analysis.ipynb`) to Colab.
3. Make sure the required libraries are installed. You can add this code block at the beginning of the notebook to install any missing packages:
    ```python
    !pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
    ```
4. Run the notebook in sequence to analyze the data and make predictions.

## Usage

After running the notebook, you will be able to:
- View exploratory visualizations.
- Train the predictive model.
- Make predictions for future gas prices.

Additionally, there is functionality to input a specific date, and the model will return an estimated price for that date (including extrapolation for future dates).

## Results

The model was able to predict natural gas prices; however, the predictions generated by the ARIMA model did not perform as well as expected. In contrast, the SARIMA model captured the underlying patterns and seasonality of the data more effectively. 

It is important to note that the `diff` function may occasionally produce NaN values, which could lead to errors if not properly handled. To ensure accurate predictions and avoid potential issues, these NaN values should be addressed before feeding the data into the model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and modeling.
- **Google Colab**: For running the Jupyter notebook online.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization
  - `statsmodels` for time series modeling
